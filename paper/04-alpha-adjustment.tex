\section{Ranked Group Fairness Verification and Model Adjustment}
To verify ranked group fairness efficiently in time $O(k)$, a pre-computed data structure of the inverse multinomial CDF with parameters $k, p_G$ and $ \alpha $ can be used.
%
The inverse CDF specifies value of a random variable such that the probability of the variable being less than or equal to that value equals a given probability (in our case $p_G$).
%
\subsection{Verifying ranked group fairness for a single protected group. }
%
For binomial distributions, i.e. where only one protected and one non-protected group is present, the inverse CDF is called the quantile function.
%
Table~\ref{tbl:ranked_group_fairness_table} shows an example of such a pre-computed data structure with different $ k $ and $ p $, using $\alpha=0.1$.
%
For instance, for $p=0.5$ we see that at least 1 candidate from the protected group is needed in the top 4 positions, and 2 protected candidates in the top 7 positions.

\subsection{Verifying ranked group fairness for multiple protected groups.}
As in the binomial case, the verification of ranked group fairness can be done efficiently with a pre-computed data structure.
%
For multiple protected groups this data structure has the shape of a tree for each $ p_G, k $ and $ \alpha $ rather than a single line as in Table~\ref{tbl:ranked_group_fairness_table}.
%
As the multinomial CDF is not injective and has hence no inverse, there is no quantile function that tells us exactly how many candidates are needed at each $ k $.
%
Instead, there are various manifestations of $ \tau_G $ that satisfy the fair representation condition $F(\tau_G;k,p_G) > \alpha$, which is why the verification data structure becomes a tree.
%
Note that each tree level corresponds to the respective ranking position, i.e. the root level corresponds to the first ranking position and so forth.
%
Also note that each path corresponds to a valid distribution of protected candidates in the ranking.
%
\input{pics/mTrees}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:mtree-symmetric-unadjusted} shows an example of such tree. It assumes there are two protected groups with minimum proportions $1/3$ and $1/3$. Levels go from left to right starting from zero. To determine how many elements of each protected group are required in the ranking, we look at all nodes at a given level, which provide the acceptable configurations.
%
For instance in this tree when there are 3 elements, there are 3 nodes named ``[2,0],'' ``[1,1],'' and ``[0,2].'' This means it is acceptable to have among the first 3 elements in the ranking either at least 2 elements from group 1, or at least 1 element from each group, or at least 2 elements from group 2.
%
The tree is symmetric when the minimum proportions are equal. Figure~\ref{fig:mtree-asymmetric-unadjusted} show the tree is asymmetric when the minimum proportions are different, in that example $0.2$ and $0.4$.

Each path in these trees corresponds to a valid strategy to place a minimum amount of protected candidates in the ranking under test (or construction).
%
These trees can be constructed using the process described in algorithms~\ref{alg:computeMTree} and~\ref{alg:imcdf}.

\subsection{Model Adjustment}
\label{subsec:group-fairness-correction}

Our ranked group fairness definition requires an adjusted significance $\alphaadj = \adj(\alpha, k, p)$, because it tests multiple hypotheses ($k$ of them).
%
If we use $\alphaadj = \alpha$, we will produce too many false positives, i.e. rejecting fair rankings, at a rate larger than $\alpha$.
%
To adjust significance, we extend a generative model for rankings with one protected group, using a binomial distribution~\cite{yang2016measuring}, to a multinomial distribution.
%
Specifically, we consider that the following ranking should be accepted by the ranked group fairness test: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item start with an empty list, and
	\item incrementally add the best protected candidate from group $g$ with probability $p_g$, or the best available non-protected candidate with probability $p_0 = 1-\sum_{j=1}^{|G|} p_j$.
\end{inparaenum}
%
``Best'' means the one with the highest utility.

To illustrate why this correction is needed, observe Figure~\ref{fig:why-adjustment-is-needed-binomial}, which assumes one protected group.
%
This figure is generated by simulation, generating rankings using the process described above and showing the probability of those rankings being rejected by our ranked group fairness test with $\alphaadj=0.1$.
%
The figure suggests that depending on $k$ we would need to change the value of $\alpha$ if we want to achieve a rejection rate of $0.1$.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:why-adjustment-is-needed-multinomial} shows the same phenomenon but for multiple protected groups and $p_1=p_2=\frac{1}{3}$.
%
We can see these rankings are rejected by our multinomial ranked group fairness test with a probability different from $\alphaadj=0.1$.
%
The curves are computed by the method we describe in the following paragraphs, and it experimentally matches the result of simulations we performed.

\begin{figure}[h]

		However we see that the rejection probability increases steeply by $k$ and the number of groups.
		Note the scale of $k$ is logarithmic.}
	\label{fig:need-for-model-adjustment}
\end{figure}

Generally, we can see that the probability of a Type-I error (declaring this fair ranking as unfair) is higher than $\alpha = 0.1$.
%
If the $k$ tests were independent, we could use $\alphaadj = 1 - (1 - \alpha)^{1/k}$ (i.e., {\v S}id{\'a}k's correction), but given the positive dependence, the false negative rate is smaller than the bound given by {\v S}id{\'a}k's correction.

We will separate the explanation of the model adjustment into two subsections: first we explain the simpler case of a binomial distribution, i.e. the presence of one non-protected and \emph{one} protected group, which can be solved analytically.
%
Second we explain the more general case of a multinomial distribution, where more than one protected group is present.

\subsubsection{Model Adjustment for One Protected Group}\label{subsubsec:adjustment-binomial}

The probability that a fair ranking, created by the process of~\citet{yang2016measuring}, passes the ranked group fairness test with parameters $(p,\alpha)$ can be computed as follows:
%
Let $m(k) = m_{\alpha,p}(k) = F^{-1}(k,p,\alpha)$ be the number of protected elements required up to position $k$.
%
Let $\minv(i) = k$ s.t. $m(k) = i$ be the position at which $i$ protected elements are required.
%
Let $b(i) = \minv(i) - \minv(i-1)$ (with $\minv(0) = 0$) be the size of a ``block,'' that is, the gap between one increase and the next in $m(\cdot)$.
%
We call the $k$-dimensional vector $(m(1), m(2), \ldots , m(k))$ a \emph{mTable}.
%
An example is shown on Table~\ref{tbl:05:example_blocks}.
%
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccccc}\toprule
		$k$    & 1 & 2 & 3 & \textbf{{4}} & 5 & 6 & \textbf{7} & 8 & \textbf{9} & 10 & 11 & \textbf{12} \\

		$m(k)$ & 0 & 0 & 0 & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{1} & 1 & 1 & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2} & 2 & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & 3  & 3  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{4}\\

		Blocks       & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{$b(1)=4$}

	\end{tabular}
	\caption[Example of different block sizes]{Example of $m(\cdot)$, $\minv(\cdot)$, and $b(\cdot)$ for $p=0.5, \alpha=0.1$.}
	\label{tbl:05:example_blocks}
\end{table}

\noindent Furthermore let
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:05:combinations}
	I_{m(k)} = \{ v = (i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_{m(k)}): \forall \ell' \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,m(k) -1 \rbrace, 0 \le i_{\ell'} \le b(\ell') \wedge \sum_{j=1}^{\ell'} i_j \ge \ell' \}
\end{equation} 
%
represent all possible ways in which a fair ranking\footnote{Note that we do not consider rankings of size 0, which always pass the test.} generated by the method of \citet{yang2017measuring} can pass the ranked group fairness test, with $i_j$ corresponding to the number of protected elements in block $j \; (\text{with } 1 \le j \le k)$.
%
As an example consider again Table~\ref{tbl:05:example_blocks}: the first block contains four positions, i.e. $b(1)=4$ and this block passes the ranked group fairness test, if it contains at least one protected candidate.
%
It also passes the test, if it contains more protected candidates, hence $i_1 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. 

The probability of considering a ranking of $k$ elements (i.e. $m(k)$ blocks) unfair, is:
\begin{equation} 
	\label{eq:05:failureProb}
	1 - \sum_{v \in I_{m(k)}} \prod_{j=1}^{m(k)} f(v_j; b(j), p)
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $f(x;b(j),p) = Pr(X = x)$ is the probability density function (pdf) of a binomially distributed variable $X \sim Bin(b(j), p)$.
%
However, if calculated naively this expression is intractable because of the large number of combinations in $I_{m(k)}$.

\input{algos/05-successProb.tex}
We therefore propose Algorithm~\ref{alg:05:successProb}, which computes the probability that a fair ranking passes the ranked group fairness test (i.e. the right term of Equation~\ref{eq:05:failureProb}) \emph{recursively}.
%
%With this algorithm however, we have to account for an important pitfall: we may choose a combination of $k, p, \alpha$ where the last block ``reaches beyond'' $k$.
%
%Consider again Table~\ref{tbl:05:example_blocks} with $k=8, \minpro$p=$0.5, \alpha=0.1$: the second block reaches until position 7, while the third block reaches until position 9.
%
%If we cut off the mTable at $k=8$ to adjust the significance level, the last block reaches beyond $k$ which is to position 9. 
%
%\meike{Inwiefern macht der neue Algorithmus das Problem mit aufgebrochenen Blöcken besser?}
%To account for that t
The algorithm breaks the vector $v = (i_1, i_2, \ldots ,i_{\ell})$ of Equation~\ref{eq:05:combinations} into a \textit{prefix} and a \textit{suffix} (Alg.~\ref{alg:05:successProb}, Line~\ref{algoline:05:suffixes}).
%
We call $i_1$ the \textit{prefix} of $(i_2, \ldots, i_{\ell})$, and $(i_2, \ldots, i_{\ell})$ the \textit{suffix} of $i_1$.
%
The algorithm starts with a prefix and calculates all possible suffixes, that pass the ranked group fairness test, recursively (Line~\ref{algoline:05:recursion}).
%
Consider the following example: for the first prefix $i_1 = 1$ the algorithm computes all possible suffixes, where we rank exactly one protected candidate in the first block.
%
For this prefix $i_1$ combined with each possible suffix $v \setminus i_1$ we calculate $\prod_{j=1}^{m(k)} f(v_j; b(j), p)$ (Line~\ref{algoline:05:pdf}), which is the probability that one particular instance of $v$ passes the ranked group fairness test (for short, we refer to it as the ``success probability'').
%
In the next recursion the prefix is $i_1=1, i_2 =1$ and the algorithm computes all possible suffixes, i.e. all rankings where we rank exactly one protected candidates in the first block and one protected candidate in the second block, and the respective success probabilities.
%
This procedure continues for $m(k)$ iterations. 
%
After that the entire procedure starts again with $i_1=2$ and is repeated until the maximum number of protected candidates is reached, in our case $b(1)=4$.
%
All intermediate success probabilities are added up (Line~\ref{algoline:05:pdf}) to the total success probability of the mTable that was created with the given setting of $k, p, \alpha$.

Note that there are at most $\prod_{j=1}^{m(k)}b(j)$ possible combinations to distribute the protected candidates within the blocks.
%
Furthermore many $v \in I_{m(k)}$ share the same prefix and hence have the same probability density value for these prefixes.
%
To reduce computation time the algorithm stores the binomial probability density value for each prefix in a hash map with the prefix as key and the respective pdf as value.
%
Thus the overall computational complexity becomes $O(\prod_{j=1}^{m(k)}b(j) \cdot O(\texttt{binomPDF}))$.

\paragraph{Finding the correct mTable.} 
To find the correct mTable, that is the mTable with an overall acceptance probability of $1-\alpha$, we propose Algorithm~\ref{alg:05:binarySearch} that takes  parameters $k, p, \alphaadj$ as input.
%
%We use Algorithm~\ref{alg:05:successProb} to determine the adjusted significance level $\alphaadj$ for the ranked group fairness test, such that the overall acceptance probability for the mTable with parameters $k, p, \alphaadj$ becomes $1-\alpha$.
%
It sequentially creates mTables (recall that these are $k$-dimensional vectors of the form $(m(1), m(2), \ldots , m(k))$) for different values of $\alphaadj$, and then calls Algorithm~\ref{alg:05:successProb} to calculate their success probability until it finds the correct mTable with overall failure probability $\alpha$ . 

\input{algos/05-binarySearchForMtable.tex}
To search for the correct mTable systematically and efficiently we perform a binary search, for which we need a discrete measure to search on.
%
We call this measure the \emph{mass} of a mTable.
%
\begin{definition}[Mass of a mTable]
	\label{def:05:Mass of a MTable}
	For $\text{mTable}_{p,k,\alpha}=(m(1) , m(2) , \ldots , m(k))$ we call\\
	$L_1(\text{mTable}_{p,k,\alpha})=\sum_{i=1}^k m(i)$ the \textit{mass of $\text{mTable}_{p,\alpha,k}$}.
\end{definition}
%
Furthermore we only want to consider only mTables with certain properties, which we define in the following paragraph.
%
This is important because we want to reduce the search space of $k$-dimensional vectors as much as possible.
%
A $k$-dimensional vector (e.g. $(0,0,1,2,3)$) has to have two properties in order to constitute a mTable, rather than just a vector of natural numbers: it has to be \emph{valid} and \emph{legal}.
%
\begin{definition}[Valid mTable]
	\label{def:05:valid-mtable}
	The $\text{mTable}_{p,k,\alpha}=(m(1) , m(2) , \ldots , m(k))$ is \emph{valid} if and only if, $m(i) \leq m(j)$ for all $i,j \in \lbrace 1, \ldots, k \rbrace$ with $i < j$ and $m(i)=n \Rightarrow m(i+1) \leq n+1$.
\end{definition}
\noindent It is easy to see that many valid mTables exist.
%
They correspond to all $k$-dimensional arrays with integers monotonically increasing by array indices.
%
However we only want to consider those valid mTables for our ranked group fairness test that have been created by the statistical process in~\citet{yang2017measuring}.
%
We call these legal mTables.
%
\begin{definition}[Legal mTable]
	\label{def:05:legal-mtable}
	A $\text{mTable}_{p,\alpha,k}$ is \textit{legal} if and only if there exists a $p,k,\alpha$ such that
	$\texttt{constructMTable}(p,k,\alpha)=\text{mTable}_{p,\alpha,k}$.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}[constructMTable]
	\label{def:05:construct-mtable-single-test}
	For $p\in [0,1], k \in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \in [0,1]$ we define a function to construct a mTable from input parameters $p, k, \alpha$ according to \cite{yang2017measuring}.
	
	\noindent$\texttt{constructMTable} : \\ (0,1) \times \mathbb{N} \times [0,1] \longrightarrow \lbrace (m(1) ,\ldots, m(k)): m(i) = F^{-1}(i,p,\alpha), \, i = \{1,\ldots,k\}\rbrace$ \\
	with $\texttt{constructMTable}(p,k,\alpha)=\text{mTable}_{p,k,\alpha}$.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:05:legal-valid-mtable}
	If a mTable is legal, it is also valid.
\end{lemma}
%
\noindent Lemma \ref{lemma:05:legal-valid-mtable} follows directly by construction. 

The definition of a legal mTable together with its corresponding mass enables us to perform a binary search, which helps us to find $\alphaadj$ and hence the correct mTable with an overall failure probability of $\alpha$.
%
Note that for any value of $\alpha$ there exists exactly one \emph{legal} mTable.
%
However, the opposite is not true: as $\alpha$ is a real number from the interval $[0, 1]$, the same mTable can be created using different (but very similar) values of $\alpha$.
%
Thus without a discrete measure for a mTable we do not know when to stop searching, which is why we introduce the \emph{mass of a mTable}.
%
Now, we have to relate the continuous $\alpha$ to the discrete measure of an mTable.
%
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:05:non-decreasing-with-alpha-mtable}
	Every $\text{mTable}_{p,k,\alpha}=\texttt{constructMTable}(p,k,\alpha)=(m(1) , m(2) , \ldots , m(k))$ is non-decreasing with $\alpha$. This means that
	$\texttt{constructMTable}(p,k,\alpha - \epsilon) = (m(1)' , m(2)' , \ldots , m(k)')$ will result in $m(i)' \leq m(i)$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$ and $\epsilon > 0$.
\end{lemma}
%
\noindent This property shows that, if we reduce $\alpha$ in our binary search, the mass of the corresponding mTable is also reduced or stays the same.
%
It very usefully implies a criterion to stop the binary search: namely we stop the calculation when the mass of the mTable of the left search boundary equals the right search boundary.
%
Of course this only works if there exists exactly one legal mTable for each mass, which we proof in the following.
\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:05:mtable-mass-injection}
	For fix $p,k$ there exists exactly one legal mTable for each mass $L_1\in \lbrace 1,\ldots,k \rbrace$.
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:05:mtable-mass-injection}
	We prove this by contradiction: Let $MT_{p,k,\alpha_1}$ and $MT'_{p,k, \alpha_2}$ be two different mTables with $L_1(MT_{p,k,\alpha_1 }) = L_1(MT'_{p,k,\alpha_2})$.\\
	%
	If both are legal then it applies that $\texttt{constructMTable}(p,\alpha_1 ,k)=MT_{p,\alpha_1 ,k}$
	and \\ $\texttt{constructMTable}(p,\alpha_2 ,k)=MT'_{p,\alpha_2 ,k}$.
	%
	Because $MT_{p,k,\alpha_1} \neq MT'_{p,k,\alpha_2}$, without loss of generality entries $m(i), m(i)' , m(j) , m(j)'$ exist in each table, such that $|m(i) - m(i)'| = |m(j) - m(j)'|$ while at the same time $m(i) > m(i)'$ , $m(j) < m(j)'$ for $i<j, i,j \in \lbrace 1, \ldots , k \rbrace$.
	%
	(Think of it as the two entries in each table "evening out", such that both tables have the same mass.)\\
	%
	If $\alpha_1 > \alpha_2$, then the statement $m(j)' > m(j)$ violates Lemma~\ref{lemma:05:non-decreasing-with-alpha-mtable}.
	%
	If $\alpha_2 > \alpha_1$, then the statement $m(i) > m(i)'$ also violates Lemma~\ref{lemma:05:non-decreasing-with-alpha-mtable}.
	%
	The only possibility left is hence that $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$, which contradicts $MT \neq MT'$, as both are created using function \texttt{constructMTable}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{The number of valid mTables.} In order to estimate the complexity of the whole procedure (and hence understand its computational feasibility), we need to know how many mTables exist for fix $k$ and $p$.
%
\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:05:number-of-mtables}
	The number of legal mTables for $k,p$ is less or equal to $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ .
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:05:number-of-mtables}
	With the proof above we can count the number of legal mTables for fix $p,k$ as follows: The maximum mass of a legal mTable of length $k$ is by construction
	$L_1 ((m(1) = 1,m(2) = 2, \ldots, m(k) = k)) = \sum_{i=1}^k m(i) = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}$
	%
	Following definition~\ref{def:05:valid-mtable} the entry $m(1)$ is either $0$ or $1$.
	%
	In turn $m(2)$ can only be $2$, if $m(1)$ was $1$ (otherwise $m(2)<2$).
	%
	Accordingly, the minimum mass of a legal mTable is $L_1((m(1),m(2), \ldots, m(k))) = 0$, if all $m(i)=0$.
	%
	We have shown that exactly one legal mTable exists for each mass.
	%
	It follows directly that there are at most $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ masses and therewith legal mTables.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Model Adjustment for Multiple Protected Groups}
\label{sec:multinomial-adjustment}
%
With the presence of more than one protected group, the analytical extension of the model adjustment to a multinomial setting is too complex to be written into a closed formula.

We found no efficient way to calculate all permutations which pass or fail the test and we choose an experimental procedure to adjust $ \alpha $.
%
It is a generalization of the binomial process suggested by~\citet{yang2016measuring} to multinomial settings:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get input $ p_G, k, \alpha $.
	\item Build mTree with input $ \alpha $.
	\item Create $M$ rankings by rolling a biased $ |G| $-sided dice with each side's probability to show corresponding to a minimum proportion in vector $ p_G $.
	\item Test all those rankings against the mTree and count how many tests fail.
	%
	Remember that we want to observe a maximum failure probability of $ \failprob=\alpha $, because all rankings created by this multinomial stochastic process are considered to be inherently fair.
	\item If $ \failprob \neq \alpha $, we choose a new $ \alphaadj $ using a binary search heuristic.
	\item Now we build a new mTree using $ \alphaadj $ and repeat the procedure until $ \failprob \approx \alpha $.
\end{enumerate}
%
This adjustment procedure requires to compute a new mTree at each iteration which is expensive on its own. Depending on the level of accuracy needed, a large number of iterations $M$ might be required.
%
Additionally the binary search heuristic needs many steps to find $\alpha$, if large intervals have to be searched.

We use three strategies to drastically reduce computational costs.
%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
%
\item we reduce the space requirements of the mTree structure;
%
\item we construct the tree level by level and reject if the ranking does not satisfy any node in a level;
%
\item we exploit the monotonicity of $\alphaadj$ with respect to $\alpha$ and use a regression procedure to speed up the binary search.
\end{inparaenum}
%
We next explain each strategy.


First, we improve the mTree data structure itself by excluding the calculation and storage of redundant information.
%
Figures~\ref{fig:mtree-symmetric-adjusted} and~\ref{fig:mtree-asymmetric-adjusted} show the mTree structure with all parent-child relations as edges.
%
In these structures, a node can only appear once at each level. Duplicate nodes are combined into a single node with multiple parents.
%
Furthermore we reduce the size of the mTree by actually leaving out the parent-child relationship and merely storing the nodes itself together with their respective depth levels.
%
This is possible because we know that, if a single node exists on each level, which accepts a given ranking as fair, then a valid path to that node exists in the tree.
%
Before we can prove this property, we need to introduce the following definition.
%
\begin{definition}[Successful mTree Testing]
\label{def:valid-mtree-test}
Let $\tau$ be a ranking of size $k$ and $\tau_{G,i}=(\tau_{1},\ldots,\tau_{|G|})$ the numbers of ranked protected elements from group $1,\ldots,|G|$ up to position $i$.
%
Let furthermore $MT$ be a $mTree$, with $MT_{G,i}=[m_1(i),\ldots,m_{|G|}(i)]$ the number of protected candidates of group $1,\ldots,|G|$ required up to position $i$.
%
We write $\tau_{G,i} \geq m_{G,i}$ if $\tau_g \geq m_g$ for all $g=1,\ldots,|G|$.
%
We call a test on level $i$ of $MT$ successful if and only if $\tau_{G,i} \geq m_{G,i}$.
\end{definition}
%
\noindent With this we can make sure that if we test a ranking on each level of the mTree successfully, the entire ranking will be fair according to the ranked group fairness definition.
%
We prove this by showing that, if a ranking passes the test for any two nodes $n_1$ and $n_2$ at two consecutive levels $h$ and $h+1$ and $n_1$ is \emph{not} a parent of $n_2$, then all actual children of $n_1$ will have a weaker requirement than $n_2$ and will hence also test successfully.
%
Furthermore we show that all nodes at level $h+1$ for which the ranking fails the test are part of a path that already rejected it as unfair at level $h$.
%
Consider an example from Figure~\ref{fig:mtree-symmetric-adjusted} : Let us assume a ranking passes the test at level $9$ with exactly the required protected items $[1,1]$.
%
Now lets assume that at level $10$, the given ranking would pass the test for node $[2,1]$, which is not a successor of $[1,1]$.
%
In fact we see that the actual successor of $[1,1]$ is a node with the same configuration $[1,1]$.
%
However, if our ranking passes the test for the stricter node $[2,1]$, it also passes for $[1,1]$ and thus we do not need to know the true parent of $[2,1]$.
%
Note that the ranking would fail at node $[3,0]$, but with $[1,1]$ at level 9 it would have failed already at $[3,0]$'s predecessor $[2,0]$.
\note[ChaTo]{I did not review the following proof.}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:lazy-mTree-test}
Let $MT$ be a mTree and $\tau$ a ranking of size $k$. If and only if there exists at least one successful test for $\tau$ at each level of $MT$, there exists a valid path from the root of $MT$ to a leaf of $MT$.
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:lazy-mTree-test}
	It is clear that at least one successful test per level is necessary for the path to exist, let us prove that it is sufficient.
	%
	Let $MT$ be a mTree and $\tau$ be a ranking that passes the test at level $h$ of $MT$.
	%
	Let $m_{G,h}=[m_{1}(h), \ldots, m_{|G|}(h)]$ be the node on level $h$ that successfully tested $\tau$.
	%
	Let further be $\tau_g(h)$ the number of protected candidates of group $g$ ranked at up to position $h$.
	%
	Without loss of generality let $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - \tau_{g}(h)| = 0$, meaning that the ranking includes the exact amount of required protected candidates at level $h$ and not more.
	%
	Let $m_{G,(h+1)}$ be a node which tests $\tau$ successfully on level $h+1$ with $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h+1) - \tau_{g}(h+1)| = 0$.
	%
	For all entries $m_{g}(h+1)$ of $m_{G,(h+1)}$ it is that $m_{g}(h) \leq m_{g}(h+1)$ by construction of the mTree in which requirements for protected candidates can only increase or stay the same.

	\noindent We can now distinguish between the following two cases:
	\\
	\textbf{Case 1:} $m_{G,(h+1)}$ is a child of $m_{G,h}$.
	%
	Then they form a path. %UNNECESSARY:% Note that $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} (m_{g}(h+1) - m_{g}(h) \leq 1)$.
	\\
	\textbf{Case 2:} $m_{G,(h+1)}$ is not a child of $m_{G,h}$.
	%
	Let now ${m'}_{G,(h+1)}$ be a child of $m_{G,(h)}$.
	%
	Because of $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - \tau_{g}(h)| = 0$, and a successful test at level $h+1$, the following inequations hold: $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| \leq 1$ and $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| \leq 1$.
	%
	If $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = \sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 0$ or $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = \sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 1$, it follows that $m_{G,(h+1)} = {m'}_{G,(h+1)}$ and we would have a contradiction with the fact that ${m'}_{G,(h+1)}$ is not a child of $m_{G,h}$, because then the nodes would be equal or different by one unit in one position.

	Hence, we need that either
	(2.1) $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = 1$ and $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 0$,
	or
	(2.2) $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = 0$ and $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 1$.
	%
	Case (2.1) means because of $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = 1 < \sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 0$ that the mTree accepts a ranking with one more protected candidate than required by the actual child of $m_{G,h}$, which contradicts our hypothesis that the ranking included the exact amount of required protected candidates. It follows that if we test $\tau_g (h+1)$ successfully with $m_{G,h+1}$ it would also satisfy ${m'}_{G,h+1}$.
Case (2.2) is impossible according to algorithm \ref{alg:imcdf}.
In detail, if $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m_g(h+1)| = 0$ it means that $ m_g(h+1) = m_{g}(h)$ and therefore, $F(m_{g}(h);h+1,p_G) > \alpha$ (line $4$ of algorithm \ref{alg:imcdf}). But if for the child of $m_{G,h}$, namely ${m'}_{G,h+1}$ it holds that $\sum_{g=1}^{|G|} |m_{g}(h) - m'_g(h+1)| = 1$, it means that
$F(m_{g}(h);h+1,p_G) \leq \alpha$ so that we would have added a new node as a child of $m_{g}(h)$ according to lines  $8-14$ of algorithm \ref{alg:imcdf}. Since both conditions cannot be true at the same time, Case (2.2) can not occur.
\\
In summary, Case (2.1) will only occur if we ranked more protected candidates than needed, and that the resulting test would be more strict than following a path through the mTree.
%
We showed that Case (2.2) is impossible. There is only Case 1 left if we have ranked exactly the number of protected candidates needed at each level of the mTree.
%
It follows that for any ranking that is tested successfully on each level of the mTree, it either was tested by nodes of a path through the mTree or was tested by a series of nodes which is more strict than such path.
\end{proof}
%
\noindent Because of theorem \ref{theorem:lazy-mTree-test} we do not need to keep the tree structure and may store only a list of tuples for each level, additionally to removing duplicate entries.
%
In case of symmetric minimum proportions $p_G$, we can further save memory and computation time, by reducing mirrored entries such as $[0,2]$ and $[2,0]$.
%
We simply flag a node for which a mirror exists on the same depth level and do not calculate the mirrored branch.

Second, we use the fact that given a value of $\alpha$, the mTree calculation is not dependent on $ k $, i.e. a mTree for $k=20$ and a mTree for $k=10$ for the same $\alpha$ are congruent within the first ten positions.
%
This means that we can start the adjustment from the root node and expand the tree gradually to find the correct $ \alphaadj $, because if $\failprob$ is too high for $k=10$ it will be too high for $k=20$ in particular and we do not have to consider the larger tree, as long as we do not have a good $\alphaadj$ for $k=10$.
%
%In order to show that we can indeed do that, assume that the for loop of algorithm \ref{alg:computeMTree} stops at $k=10$ instead of $k=20$.
%
%Furthermore, we can understand the mTree as a set of rules that a ranking has to satisfy.
%
%If there are no rules for how many protected candidates are required after position $10$, this is equivalent to not requiring more protected candidates after position $10$.
%
%Thus, the probability that a fair ranking is rejected by a shorter mTree is less or equal to a deeper mTree.
%
%We utilize this property to lower computational costs: we calculate the mTree for $k=10$, then create 10000 rankings of length 10 and calculate $ \alphaadj $ under this setting.
%
%Then we set $ k=k+ $\texttt{stepsize}, and repeat the procedure until we reach the desired ranking length.
%
We can see in Figure \ref{fig:need-for-model-adjustment} that $ \failprob $ grows very fast for small $k$, which makes an early adjustment of $\alpha$ most efficient to save computation time.

Third, we use a second-degree polynomial regression model to get our first estimate for a good $\alphaadj$ candidate and apply the binary search heuristic from that candidate, rather than starting with a random value, that might be very far away from the correct $\alphaadj$.
%
In this case we give as input a few additional parameters: \texttt{kTarget} -- the length of the target ranking, \texttt{kStart} -- the size of the first mTree, \texttt{maxPreAdjustK} -- the maximum size of the mTree before we use regression to predict a good candidate $\alpha_{c_r}$ for the final $\alphaadj$, and \texttt{num\_iterations} -- the number of training instances to be computed.
%
To create a training dataset $R$, we compute \texttt{num\_iterations} small mTrees (i.e. with different $k \leq $ \texttt{maxPreAdjustK}) and adjust the respective $\alpha$ values as described in the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:multinomial-adjustment}.
%
For each iteration $j$ the pair $(k_j, \alpha_{c_j})$ is stored as a training instance in $R$.

%
Figure~\ref{fig:regression-training-data} shows a training set for $p_G=[1/3, 1/3], \texttt{maxPreAdjustK}=100$.
%
Then a regression model is trained to predict $\alpha_{c_r}$ for \texttt{kTarget}.
%
This $\alpha_{c_r}$ is now used to start the binary search for the correct and final $\alphaadj$.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:regression-time-saved} shows the runtime difference for the model adjustment routine with and without the use of linear regression.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:regression_search} shows the overall adjustment procedure in pseudo-code and performs the following steps:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define the necessary parameters: \texttt{kTarget}, \texttt{kStart}, \texttt{maxPreAdjustK}, and \texttt{num\_iterations}
	\item Adjust $\alpha$ for a mTree of size \texttt{kStart} to get $\alpha_{c_1}$ using binary search.
	\item Add pair $\left(\texttt{kStart}, \alpha_{c_1}\right)$ to a regression training set $R$.
	\item \label{stepBegin} Increase $\texttt{kStart}$ by $\texttt{stepsize}=\frac{\texttt{maxPreAdjustK}}{\texttt{num\_iterations}}$
	\item Compute a mTree with parameters $\texttt{kTarget}, p_G, \alpha_{c_1}$ and adjust $\alpha_{c_1}$.
	\item \label{stepEnd} Name result $\alpha_{c_2}$ and add pair $\left(\texttt{kStart}, \alpha_{c_2}\right)$ to $R$.
	\item Repeat steps (\ref{stepBegin}) -- (\ref{stepEnd}) until $\texttt{kStart} == \texttt{maxPreAdjustK}$.
	\item Train a regression model with training data $R$ to predict $\alpha_{c_r}$ for $\texttt{kTarget}$.
	\item Use binary search (Algorithm~\ref{alg:mult_binary}) to find $\alphaadj$ for parameters $k,p_G, \alpha_{c_r}$.

Once we found $\alphaadj$ we can recompute the mTrees from  Figures~\ref{fig:mtree-symmetric-unadjusted} and~\ref{fig:mtree-asymmetric-unadjusted} to obtain an overall significance level of $\alpha$.

Figures~\ref{fig:mtree-symmetric-adjusted} and~\ref{fig:mtree-asymmetric-adjusted} show the adjusted mTrees with the same parameters $p_G$.
